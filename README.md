# ClosedStepper Library #

Closed loop control of stepper motors using arduino. This is just a simple subclassing of the excellent AccelStepper library classes with the appropriate changes.
THIS IS JUST A VIABILITY TEST TO SEE IF IT CAN WORK. NOT RECOMENDED FOR USE YET.
If this actually works well I will probably try to push these changes in to AccelStepper in a backward compatable way.
